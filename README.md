Zero-index metamaterials

Metamaterials are materials that have been designed to have properties that are not found in nature. They are often used to create materials with unusual electromagnetic properties, such as negative refraction or negative permeability.and negative permittivity.and also left-handed materials.and double-negative materials.and zero-index materials.
 
Metamaterials are a subset of functional materials. They are composite structures, consisting of conventional materials such as metals and plastics, that are engineered by META scientists to exhibit new or enhanced properties. “Metamaterial” refers to any material that gains its properties from structure rather than composition. Metamaterials have been used to create microwave invisibility cloaks, 2D invisibility cloaks, and materials with other unusual optical properties.

What are the types of metamaterials?
- Electromagnetic Metamaterials.
- Single Negative Metamaterials.
- Double Negative Metamaterial.
- Photonic Metamaterial.
- Acoustic Metamaterials.
- Mechanical Metamaterials.

What are the major properties of metamaterials? Ivisibility. Due to their peculiar optical capabilities (wavelength shorter than visible light), metamaterials can be invisible. ...Acoustic control. ... Negative electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability. ...they enable the extreme miniaturization of existing optical devices. For example, we can take an eyeglass lens and we can make it 100 times thinner than a strand of hair. This allows us to translate traditionally bulky optical systems to extremely small form factors.
